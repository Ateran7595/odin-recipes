        <h1>Meat Sauce Pasta Recipe</h1>

        <img src="../images/meatpasta.jpg" width="400" height="400">
        <p>Here's an easy pressure cooker spaghetti and meat sauce recipe with ground beek, jar pasta sauce, spaghetti noodles and more.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Ground beef</li>
            <li>Pasta sauce</li>
            <li>Seasonings</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Spaghetti</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Use the Instant Pot "Saute" function to saute onions, garlic, ground beef, and seasonings until beef is cooked through. Deglaze the pot by adding a splash of broth and scraping the bottom to release any browned bits.</li>
            <li>Press "Cancel" on the Instant Pot. Break pasta noodles in half and criss-cross in stacks over the beef. Add the water or broth, followed by the pasta sauce. Press the noodles under the liquid to submerge.</li>
            <li>Pressure cook by selecting the "Manual" or "Pressure Cook" button set on HIGH for 2 minutes (for al dente spaghetti) or 3 minutes (for soft spaghetti noodles) followed by 10 minute (NPR) natural pressure release.</li>
            <li>Press "Cancel" and open the lid. It will look unusual at first (see photos below), but trust me, it all works out. Toss everything together to combine. I recommend turning the "keep warm" setting off to prevent overcooking the spaghetti.</li>
            <li>Serve warm with a little Parmesan cheese and fresh parsley.</li>
        </ol>
