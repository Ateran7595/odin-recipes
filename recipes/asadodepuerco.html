        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pulse 1 medium green bell pepper, ribs and seeds removed, coarsely chopped, 1 medium red bell 
            pepper, ribs and seeds removed, coarsely chopped, ½ small bunch cilantro, leaves with tender stems 
            picked, 6 garlic cloves, 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, and 1 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¾ tsp. 
            Morton kosher salt in a food processor until a coarse purée forms. (Makes about 2¼ cups.) Do ahead: 
            Sofrito can be made 3 days ahead. Transfer to an airtight container; cover and chill, or freeze up 
            to 1 month.</li>
            <li>Whisk 4 tsp. ground cumin, 1 Tbsp. powdered adobo seasoning, 1 tsp. ground turmeric, and 1 tsp. 
            paprika in a small bowl. Sprinkle half of spice mixture all over 8 skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs 
            (about 3 lb.).</li>
            <li>Heat 1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium. Working 
            in batches, arrange chicken, skin side down, in pot and cook, undisturbed, until skin is golden brown,
            8-10 minutes. Turn over and cook until other side is browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer chicken to a 
            plate.</li>
            <li>Add 1 medium onion, finely chopped, and 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped, to pot and cook, 
            stirring often, until onion is softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add 1 Tbsp. tomato paste 
            and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Stir in ½ cup sofrito and remaining spice mixture and cook, stirring, 
            until fragrant and mixture is slightly darkened, about 3 minutes. Pour in one 8-oz. can tomato sauce 
            and 2½ cups low-sodium chicken broth; stir to combine, scraping up any browned bits stuck to bottom 
            of pot.</li>
            <li>Return chicken pieces to pot, arranging skin side up, and bring stew to a simmer. Cover with a 
            lid and cook, adjusting heat as needed to maintain a simmer, until chicken is cooked through, 25-30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Uncover pot and stir in 1 cup pitted manzanilla olives. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until stew 
            is slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Taste stew and season with kosher salt if 
            needed.</li>
            <li>To serve, divide steamed rice among bowls and ladle stew over; top with cilantro leaves with 
            tender stems. Serve with lime wedges.</li>
        </ol>
